<p>Software brains for computers that do stuff. Everythin from fun and
games to data mining to physical robotics. This is a great hobbiest
area of AI with many areas of interest to pursue. I've broken it down
loosely into 2 sections. AI for purely software based agents and that
for embodied agents (even if only simulated).</p>

        </h2>


<p>Also known as intelligent software agents or just agents, this
area of AI research deals with simple applications of small
programs that aid the user in his/her work. They can be mobile
(able to stop their execution on one machine and resume it on
another) or static (live in one machine). They are usually
specific to the task (and therefore fairly simple) and meant
to help the user much as an assistant would.</p>

<p>2APL (pronounced as double-a-p-l) is an agent-oriented programming
language that facilitates the implementation of multi-agent systems. At
the multi-agent level, it provides programming constructs to specify a
multi-agent system in terms of a set of individual agents, a set of
environments in which they can perform actions, and the access relation
between the individual agents and the environments. At the individual
agent level, it provides programming constructs to implement cognitive
agents based on the BDI architecture.</p>

<p>3APL is a programming language for implementing cognitive agents. It
provides programming constructs for implementing agents' beliefs,
goals, basic capabilities (such as belief updates, external actions, or
communication actions) and a set of practical reasoning rules through
which agents' goals can be updated or revised. The 3APL programs are
executed on the 3APL platform. Each 3APL program is executed by means
of an interpreter that deliberates on the cognitive attitudes of that
agent.</p>

<p>An aglet is a Java object that can move from one host on the
Internet to another.  That is, an aglet that executes on one host can
suddenly halt execution, dispatch to a remote host, and resume
execution there. When the aglet moves, it takes along its program code
as well as its state (data). A built-in security mechanism makes it
safe for a computer to host untrusted aglets. The Java Aglet API
(J-AAPI) is a proposed public standard for interfacing aglets and
their environment. J-AAPI contains methods for initializing an aglet,
message handling, and dispatching, retracting,
deactivating/activating, cloning, and disposing of the aglet. J-AAPI
is simple, flexible, and stable. Application developers can write
platform-independent aglets and expect them to run on any host that
supports J-AAPI.</p>

<p>AJA (Adaptable Java Agents) consists of two programming languages.
HADL (Higher Agent Definition Language) is a higher-level language used

It is actually Java enriched with the constructs for accessing
higher-level agent parts defined in HADL.</p>

<p>The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup
Language), a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat
robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism. Compared with
other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest. The pattern
matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one
wild-card ('*') match character per pattern. AIML is an XML language,
implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. The choice of
XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.
Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to
people with HTML experience.</p>

<p>A transportable agent is a program that can migrate from machine
to machine in a heterogeneous network.  The program chooses when and
where to migrate.  It can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point,
transport to another machine and resume execution on the new machine.
For example, an agent carrying a mail message migrates first to a
router and then to the recipient's mailbox.  The agent can perform
arbitrarily complex processing at each machine in order to ensure that
the message reaches the intended recipient.</p>

trading scenarios based on fish market auctions (Dutch auctions). FM
provides the framework wherein agent designers can perform controlled
experimentation in such a way that a multitude of experimental market
scenarios--that we regard as tournament scenarios due to the
competitive nature of the domain-- of varying degrees of realism and
complexity can be specified, activated, and recorded; and trading
(buyer and seller) heterogeneous (human and software) agents compared,

<p>JAM supports both top-down, goal-based reasoning and bottom-up
data-driven reasoning. JAM selects goals and plans based on maximal
priority if metalevel reasoning is not used, or user-developed
metalevel reasoning plans if they exist. JAM's conceptualization of
goals and goal achievement is more classically defined (UMPRS is more
behavioral performance-based than truly goal-based) and makes the
distinction between plans to achieve goals and plans that simply encode
behaviors. Goal-types implemented include achievement (attain a
specified world state), maintenance (re-attain a specified world
state), and performance. Execution of multiple simultaneous goals are
supported, with suspension and resumption capabilities for each goal
(i.e., intention) thread. JAM plans have explicit precondition and
runtime attributes that restrict their applicability, a postcondition
attribute, and a plan attributes section for specifying 
plan/domain-specific plan features. Available plan constructs include:
sequencing, iteration, subgoaling, atomic (i.e., non-interruptable)
plan segments, n-branch deterministic and non-deterministic conditional
execution, parallel execution of multiple plan segments, goal-based or
world state-based synchronization, an explicit failure-handling
section, and Java primitive function definition through building it
into JAM as well as the invocation of predefined (i.e., legacy) class
members via Java's reflection capabilities without having to build it

<p>The JAT provides a fully functional template, written entirely in

peer-to-peer with a community of other agents distributed over the
Internet. Although portions of the code which define each agent are
portable, JAT agents are not migratory but rather have a static
existence on a single host. This behavior is in contrast to many other
"agent" technologies. (However, using the Java RMI, JAT agents could
dynamically migrate to a foreign host via an agent resident on that
host).  Currently, all agent messages use KQML as a top-level protocol
or message wrapper. The JAT includes functionality for dynamically
exchanging "Resources", which can include Java classes (e.g. new
languages and interpreters, remote services, etc.), data files and
information inlined into the KQML messages.</p>

<p>ORTS is a programming environment for studying real-time AI problems
such as pathfinding, dealing with imperfect information, scheduling,
and planning in the domain of RTS games. These games are fast-paced and
very popular. Furthermore, the current state of RTS game AI is bleak
which is mainly caused by the lack of planning and learning - areas in
which humans are currently much better than machines. Therefore, RTS
games make an ideal test-bed for real-time AI research. Unfortunately,
commercial RTS games are closed software which prevents researchers
from connecting remote AI modules to them. Furthermore, commercial RTS
games are based on peer-to-peer technology - which in a nutshell runs
the entire simulation on all player machines and just hides part of the
game state from the players. By tampering with the client software it
is possible to reveal the entire game state and thereby gain an unfair
advantage. We feel that this is unacceptable for playing games on the
internet. We therefore started the ORTS project to create a free
software system that lets people and machines play fair RTS games. The
communication protocol is public and all source code and artwork is
freely available. Users can connect whatever client software they like.
This is made possible by a server/client architecture in which only the
currently visible parts of the game state are sent to the players. This
openness leads to new and interesting possibilities ranging from
on-line tournaments of autonomous AI players to gauge their playing
strength to hybrid systems in which human players use sophisticated
GUIs which allow them to delegate tasks to AI helper modules of
increasing performance.</p>

<p>spyse is a development framework and platform for building multi-agent
systems using the Python programming language. A multi-agent system
(MAS) combines concepts from distributed computing and artificial
intelligence.  Agents are autonomously reasoning software entities that
can collaborate (or compete) in order to achieve a (common) goal. By
cooperating they create emergent behaviour in the system (distributed
artificial intelligence). The architecture of a MAS is specified in the
FIPA standard.</p>
<p>Spyse provides multiple means for reasoning (BDI logics, CLIPS expert
shell, etc.) and communicating locally and remotely.</p>
<p>Each agent has its own thread of control. Agents within and among
instances of the platform communicate by exchanging messages based on
ontologies. Spyse makes use of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) defined
for the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>An agent is a process that may migrate through a computer network
in order to satisfy requests made by clients. Agents are an attractive
way to describe network-wide computations.</p>
<p>The TACOMA project focuses on operating system support for agents and
how agents can be used to solve problems traditionally addressed by
operating systems. We have implemented a series of prototype systems
to support agents.</p>
<p>TACOMA Version 1.2 is based on UNIX and TCP. The system supports
agents written in C, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python, and Scheme (Elk). It is
implemented in C. This TACOMA version has been in public domain since
April 1996.</p>
<p>We are currently focusing on heterogeneity, fault-tolerance, security
and management issues. Also, several TACOMA applications are under
construction. We implemented StormCast 4.0, a wide-area network
weather monitoring system accessible over the internet, using TACOMA

<p>Cadaver is a simulated world of cyborgs and nature in realtime.  The
battlefield consists of forests, grain, water, grass, carcass (of

the rules.  You start a server and connect some clients.  The clients
communicate with the server using a very primitive protocol.  They can
order cyborgs to harvest grain, attack enemies or cut forest.  The game
is not intended to be played by humans!  There is too much to control.
Only for die-hards: Just telnet to the server and you can enter
commands by hand.  Instead the idea is that you write artificial  
intelligence clients to beat the other artificial intelligences.  You
can choose a language (and operating system) of your choice to do that
task.  It is enough to write a program that communicates on standard
input and standard output channels.  Then you can use programs like
"socket" to connect your clients to the server.  It is NOT needed to
write TCP/IP code, although i did so :) The battle shall not be boring,
and so there is the so called spyboss client that displays the action
graphically on screen.</p>

<p>ROS is an operating system for your robot. It provides the services you
would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction,
low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used
functionality, message-passing between processes, and package
management. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining,
building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.</p>

<p>Simbad is a Java 3d robot simulator for scientific and educationnal
purposes.  It is mainly dedicated to researchers/programmers who want
a simple basis for studying Situated Artificial Intelligence, Machine
Learning, and more generally AI algorithms, in the context of
Autonomous Robotics  and  Autonomous Agents. It is not intented to
provide a real world simulation and is kept voluntarily readable and
simple.</p>
<p>Simbad enables programmers to write their own robot controller, modify
the environment and use the available sensors. Don't think of it as a
finite product but merely as an opened framework to test your own
ideas.</p>

<p>TclRobots is a programming game, similar to 'Core War'.  To play
TclRobots, you must write a Tcl program that controls a robot.  The
robot's mission is to survive a battle with other robots.  Two, three,
or four robots compete during a battle, each running different
programs (or possibly the same program in different robots.)  Each
robot is equipped with a scanner, cannon, drive mechanism.  A single
match continues until one robot is left running.  Robots may compete
individually, or combine in a team oriented battle.  A tournament
can be run with any number of robot programs, each robot playing every
other in a round-robin fashion, one-on-one.  A battle simulator is
available to help debug robot programs.</p>
<p>The TclRobots program provides a physical environment, imposing
certain game parameters to which all robots must adhere.  TclRobots
also provides a view on a battle, and a controlling user interface.
TclRobots requirements: a wish interpreter built from Tcl 7.4 and Tk
4.0.</p>

<p>URBI is a Universal Real-time Behavior Interface and gives you a simple
but powerful way to control any robot or complex system like a video
game, using a convenient and easy to use scripting language that can be
interfaced with several popular programming languages (C++, Java,
Matlab,...) and OS (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux). URBI is based on a
client/server architecture, which give a great deal of flexibility.
URBI includes powerful features compared to existing scripting
solutions: parallel execution of commands, event programming, command
tagging, dynamic variables,... Currently, URBI is used as well by
academic research labs, the industry and by hobbyists.</p>

<p>Vworld is a simulated environment for research with autonomous
agents written in prolog. It is currently in something of an
beta stage. It works well with SWI-prolog, but should work with
Quitnus-prolog with only a few changes.  It is being designed to
serve as an educational tool for class projects dealing with
prolog and autonomous agents. It comes with three demo worlds or
environments, along with sample agents for them. There are
two versions now. One written for SWI-prolog and one written for
LPA-prolog. Documentation is roughly done (with a
student/professor framework in mind).</p>

<p>FRP system with robotics library and graphical interactive robotics
simulator.</p>
<p>Functional reactive programming, or FRP, is a paradigm for programming
hybrid systems  i.e., systems containing a combination of both
continuous and discrete components  in a high-level, declarative way.
The key ideas in FRP are its notions of continuous, time-varying
values, and time-ordered sequences of discrete events. Yampa is an
instantiation of FRP as a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell.</p>

<p>YARP is plumbing for robot software.  It is a set of libraries,
protocols, and tools to keep modules and devices cleanly decoupled. It
is reluctant middleware, with no desire or expectation to be in control
of your system.</p>
<p>More specifically, YARP supports building a robot control system as a
collection of programs communicating in a peer-to-peer way, with a
family of connection types that meet the diverse, sometimes
contradictory, and always changing needs of advanced robotics. We also
encourage compilation and use of hardware devices in a future-proof
way. Our strategic goal is to increase the longevity of robot software
projects.</p>
